# simulator_scheduling
The simulation can evaluate scheduling algorithms results on proposed architecture. The simulation is using different batches and their various demands, various topology sizes in basic consumers, and different consumers parameters settings. The simulation simulates a single Data DC K. The K can have any number of consumers (either DCs or Basic consumers or both). All nodes inside basic consumers have a single non-negative number, specifying the capacities and all nodes have their original storage spaces. The design of a simulator is promising
to examine the performance of scheduling algorithms. To run simulation, we built a simulator which can use dynamic system settings.
